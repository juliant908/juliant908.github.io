# Spotify

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5.

## Inspiration 
My main inspiration was [@midudev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRc8lz-bp78&ab_channel=midulive) who made a Spotify clone using Astro, Svelte, React and Tailwind, so I decided to give it a try and make it in Angular 17 with Tailwind and also using Material Angular for the slider components (they weren't my favorite though...)

### Technologies used
- Angular signals
- Angular 17 conditionals
- Tailwind CSS (with a bit of SCSS but looking back it was unneccesary)
- Material Angular

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
